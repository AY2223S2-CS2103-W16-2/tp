## Contributions

* **New Feature**: Added the `salary` parameter for `add` command.
  * What it does: User can input `salary` for the `roles`.
  * Justification: The addition of `salary` is important for any applicant looking to apply for internships/jobs,    
    providing them with the information they need to make more informed
    decisions about their job search.
  * Highlights: TechTrack users can now add salaries of respective roles. `salary` must be
    integers/float values and their values must not start with a 0.


* **New Feature**: Add a new `company` command to allow filtering of the `company` field.
  * What it does: Allows users to filter companies by the keyword specified. e.g. `company Google`
  * Justification: Filtering by company names is important as it speeds up the process of
    finding relevant companies that the user is interested in applying for.
  * Highlights: Makes it more friendly for the user to search through different roles.
    The keyword entered is not case-sensitive.


* **Implementation**: Add a new `CompanyContainsKeywordPredicate` class to check for keywords in the `company` field.
  * What it does: Allow developers to check for equivalence of keywords and testing.
  * Justification: Follows the original Name command format of AB3 where the Name of the role is filtered
    by `NameContainsKeywordPredicate`. 
  * Highlights: Allows for a separate, unique predicate checking on keywords parsed to the `Company` command.


* **Refactoring**: Refactored all instances of `Person` to `role` in all the files.
  * What it does: Renamed all methods, classes and variables that contain `Person` or `person`
    to `role`.
  * Justification: Roles fits towards TechTrack instead of person in AB3 and would be clearer for future developments.
  * Highlights: Refactored AB3 code and tests.


* **Testing**: Tests new implementation and class created.
  * What it does: Allow the code to be covered by more tests and making it more robust.
  * Justification: New classes such as `CompanyCommandParser`, `Salary` and `CompanyCommand` have test cases in their
    respective test classes. These tests are written to ensure the reliability of these classes.
  * Highlights: Better code coverage and robustness of TechTrack.
