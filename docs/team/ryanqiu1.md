### Project: TechTrack

TechTrack is a powerful internship/job tracking application that combines the flexibility of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Designed for computing students and professionals, TechTrack helps you manage your internship search project by setting goals, tracking deadlines, and providing clear feedback on your progress. Its CLI interface is optimized for speed, efficiency, and ease of use, making it a valuable tool for students who are already familiar with CLI environments.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **Added Website field to add command** [Implemented]: Added the ability to add the field of website to the Role Card
    * What it does: Allows the company website to be added by the user.
    * Justification: Many Companies have their own website and the user might want to store the website somewhere.
    * Highlights: E.G. Company of Google (www.google.com) `w/www.google.com`
    * Credits: @RyanQiu1
    

* **Added Deadline Command** [Implemented]:
    * What it does: Allows the user to sort the deadline of role application by ascending or descending order.
    * Justification: Users might forget the deadline for the application of the job, hence can sort by the deadline.
    * Highlights: Using the command `deadline asc`, shows the nearest application that the user should apply.
