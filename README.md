# TechTrack User Guide

TechTrack is a powerful internship/job tracking application that combines the flexibility of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Designed for computing students and professionals, TechTrack helps you manage your internship search project by setting goals, tracking deadlines, and providing clear feedback on your progress. Its CLI interface is optimized for speed, efficiency, and ease of use, making it a valuable tool for students who are already familiar with CLI environments.

# Quick Start
Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
Download the latest `TechTrack.jar` from here.
Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AddressBook.
Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TechTrack.jar` command to run the application.
A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
